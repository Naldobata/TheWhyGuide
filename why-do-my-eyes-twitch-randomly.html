          Why Do My Eyes Twitch Randomly? Causes, Meaning, and When to Worry
        </h1>

        <p class="article-intro">
          People often notice a strange sensation in their eyelid — a small,
          repetitive twitch that seems to come and go on its own. If you’ve ever
          asked yourself “why do my eyes twitch randomly?”, you’re not alone.
          Eye twitching is extremely common in the United States, and in most
          cases, it’s harmless.
        </p>

        <h2>What Is an Eye Twitch?</h2>
        <p>
          An eye twitch, medically known as myokymia, is an involuntary spasm of
          the eyelid muscles. It usually affects the lower eyelid but can
          sometimes involve the upper lid. The twitch may last a few seconds,
          minutes, or even days.
        </p>

        <h2>Common Causes of Random Eye Twitching</h2>

        <p>
          The most common reason people experience eye twitching is stress. High
          stress levels can overstimulate nerves and muscles, leading to small
          spasms. Many Americans report eye twitching during busy work periods
          or emotional stress. Another frequent cause is lack of sleep. When
          your body is overtired, your nervous system becomes more sensitive,
          increasing the chances of muscle twitching, including around the eyes.
          Caffeine intake also plays a role. Drinking too much coffee, energy
          drinks, or soda can overstimulate your nervous system and trigger
          eyelid spasms. This is especially common in people who consume
          caffeine throughout the day. Eye strain from long hours staring at
          screens is another major factor. Phones, laptops, and TVs force your
          eyes to work harder, which can irritate the eye muscles.
        </p>

        <h2>Can Dehydration Cause Eye Twitching?</h2>
        <p>
          Yes. Mild dehydration can affect nerve signals and muscle function, which may lead to eye twitching. Many people in the U.S. don’t drink enough water during the day, especially when working indoors.
        </p>

        <h2>Is Eye Twitching a Sign of Something Serious?</h2>
        <p>
          In most cases, eye twitching is harmless and temporary. However, if the twitching lasts for several weeks, affects other parts of the face, or is accompanied by vision changes, it may be worth seeing a doctor.
        </p>

        <h2>How to Stop Eye Twitching</h2>
        <p>
          Reducing stress, improving sleep, limiting caffeine, staying hydrated, and taking breaks from screens can significantly reduce eye twitching. Artificial tears may also help if dry eyes are a factor.
